#Social Media Sharing Buttons
Social media buttons to share your page to social media; already configured to use font-awesome icons.

The current library of social media list includes:
* Facebook
* Twitter
* LinkedIn
* Pinterest

#Next update
In the next version I will add options to customise the icons displayable.
ie: as a user i will only want to display facebook and twitter in the footer of the page, however in the header I would like to have all icons.


#How to use
Add the library into your page footer and make sure that on the pages exists an element with a class named: `socialMedia` .

#Log

##v1.1
It's a remake of Master branch and v1.0 where it was configured with 2 libraries one of which was a jQuery approach.

This new version is build only into JavaScript and the library has 1.5kb compressed. Also I have added a composer.json to be easier to install.
